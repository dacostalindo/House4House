-- silver_unified_developments — one row per marketed real-estate development,
-- de-duplicated across the 4 listing portals. Sprint-09 Slice B-prime.
--
-- Portal scope: idealista, RE/MAX, Zome, JLL. SCE is intentionally *not* merged
-- in: SCE buildings (certified physical buildings) and portal developments
-- (marketed projects) are different concepts that resist clean merging — no
-- shared identifier, no shared geocoding precision, no shared address grain.
-- Atlas Inspector / fn_assess_polygon query silver_unified_developments AND
-- silver_sce_buildings side-by-side ("marketed developments here + certified
-- buildings here") instead of trying to fuse them into one row.
--
-- Phase 1 — portal dedup, name-driven. Portal coordinates disagree by 200-300m+
-- for the same development (RE/MAX can sit near the parish centroid, idealista
-- averages unit geocodes), so proximity is NOT the grouping key. Instead:
-- normalize the project name (deaccent; strip typology codes T1/T2/T1+1,
-- boilerplate words empreendimento/edifício/the, and a trailing concelho name;
-- punctuation → space), tokenize, and link two portal listings when their
-- word-sets have Jaccard overlap >= 0.6 AND they share a concelho. A 1km
-- distance ceiling is a guardrail (skipped when a coord is missing). Connected
-- components over those links → one development per component.
--
-- Geometry hierarchy — the development takes geom + concelho + parish from the
-- highest-priority portal present that has coordinates: JLL > Zome > RE/MAX >
-- idealista. geo_key (Decision 10) resolved by point-in-polygon of the unified
-- geom against dim_geography.freguesia_geom_pt.
--
-- Unit counts: portal_unit_counts (JSONB) exposes every portal's reported count
-- without picking an "authoritative" one — each portal's count has different
-- semantics (idealista = listed-units subset per the 2026-05-22 facade audit;
-- Zome = inventory; JLL = total fractions; RE/MAX = listings at RE/MAX). The
-- consumer reads the breakdown and decides what to display; no laundered total.
--
-- NOTE: unified_development_id is a within-build surrogate. The stable identity
-- of a development is the content of portal_refs.

WITH RECURSIVE

-- ── Phase 1: portal developments ──────────────────────────────────────────
-- NULL-geom portal devs are kept (they can still match by name); a development
-- with no geom-bearing member at all is dropped at portal_dev_geo.
