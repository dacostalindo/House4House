## Pydantic AI for image_classification_dag.py

**What:** wrap the LLM calls in [pipelines/portals/idealista/image_classification_dag.py](pipelines/portals/idealista/image_classification_dag.py) with Pydantic AI for typed outputs (replacing whatever ad-hoc string parsing currently lives there).

**Why:** typed schema for image-tag silver columns; consistent with the Pydantic AI pattern landed for description enrichment in Phase 5 of the dev-tooling design.

**Context:** Phase 5 of the 2026-05-05 dev-tooling design lands Pydantic AI for *description* enrichment. Image classification is the natural next surface — same shape (LLM input → typed Pydantic output → dlt → silver), different content. Hold until Phase 5 ships and the pattern is exercised once in production.

**Depends on:** Phase 5 of `manuellindo-main-design-20260505-120707.md` (Idealista description enrichment).

## Graduate `ty` from advisory to gating CI step

**What:** flip the `continue-on-error: true` flag off in the GitHub Actions workflow added in Phase 4, making `ty check` a hard gate on PRs.

**Why:** type errors should block PRs once tooling is mature, same as `ruff check`. Today ty is in preview and noisy enough that gating would cause more friction than it saves.

**Context:** Phase 6 of the 2026-05-05 dev-tooling design lands ty as advisory. Trigger to graduate is external — Astral declaring ty stable. No deadline. Watch the Astral blog and ty changelog.

**Depends on:** Astral marking ty stable (external trigger, no internal blocker).
